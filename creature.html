                    <h1>Types of Supernatural Creatures</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <h2>Vampires</h2>
                    <p>Vampires are magically reanimated human corpses which are inhabited by the spirits of the deceased
                        person and who closely resemble the living human they were before their transformation. Vampires
                        feed and survive on the blood of the living, typically on that of humans, and they can also
                        transform other humans into more of their kind by sharing their own blood with them. Vampires are
                        one of the many known supernatural species in The Vampire Diaries and The Originals universe that
                        were created by Witches.</p>
                    <h4>Originals</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Original Vampires, or simply The Originals, are a group of extremely powerful vampires that are
                        known for being the first of their bloodlines and the first generation of vampires, which makes them
                        the oldest, fastest, strongest, and most powerful vampires in the world. Their name is a term used
                        to describe a progenitor in a vampire bloodline. The term was initially introduced when Rose
                        revealed their existence to Elena, Stefan and Damon, and primarily refers to the Mikaelson Family,
                    </p>

                    <h2>Witches</h2>
                    <p>
                        Witches are supernatural beings who are born with the power to affect change by magical means
                        (Witchcraft). While many witches are the self-proclaimed "Keepers of the Balance," other witches
                        have been known to work against the Balance and use their power for personal gain.

                    <h2>Werewolves</h2>
                    <p>
                        Werewolves (also called Lycanthropes, Loup Garou, Rougarou, Beasts, or even just Wolves for short)
                        are a supernatural shapeshifting species of individuals who unwillingly transform into large,
                        fearsome, and extremely hostile wolves on the night of the full moon. They were created by the witch
                        The Hollow as revenge against her tribe for killing her.Even in their human form, werewolves possess
                        superhuman physical prowess, though not to the same level as a vampire, and their abilities are not
                        as powerful compared to those they possess on the full moon while transformed. These creatures are
                        the most dangerous enemies of vampires due to their venomous bite, which is lethal to them.
                        Werewolves are also hardwired to kill vampires on sight in their wolf form, though they still hunt
                        human prey whenever there are no vampires to kill.

                    <h2>Hybrids</h2>
                    <p>
                        Hybrids are a cross-breed of two or more different supernatural species. The term is commonly used
                        to describe a werewolf turned into a vampire due to the fact that they were the first supernatural
                        hybrid to be introduced in the series. However, since the werewolf-vampire hybrid's creation, there
                        have been other cross-breed hybrids revealed in the series' universe, such as Siphoner turned
                        witch-vampire hybrids, werewolf-witch hybrids, and, in the rare case of Hope Mikaelson, a
                        witch-werewolf-vampire tribrid.
                        Hybrids possess both the strengths and some of the weaknesses of their parent races, along with
                        powerful attributes unique to themselves alone due to their combined heritage. For werewolf-vampire
                        hybrids, this includes Day Walking and being able to transform into a wolf without the Full Moon's
                        influence. For siphoner-vampire hybrids, they retain their ability to siphon magic and their own
                        vampirism as a power source for their use in witchcraft; as they did not possess their own magic as
                        humans, this is a skill that makes them powerful.
