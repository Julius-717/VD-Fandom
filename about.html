            <p>Four months after the tragic car accident that killed her parents, 17-year-old Elena Gilbert and her
                15-year-old brother Jeremy are still learning how to deal with grief and move their lives forward. Elena
                has always been the "perfect girl": popular, beautiful, and full of friends. But now she must learn to
                hide her sadness from the world. As the new school year begins, Elena and her classmates are fascinated
                by a mysterious and charming new classmate, Stefan Salvatore. Stefan and Elena immediately approach,
                unbeknownst to the girl that Stefan is a hundreds-year-old vampire, fighting for a peaceful life among
                humans, while her brother, Damon, is the embodiment of vampire violence and brutality. Now these two
                vampire brothers - one good, one bad - are at war for Elena's soul and the souls of her friends, family,
                and all the inhabitants of the small town of Mystic Falls. The series is based on LJ Smith's novels.</p>
