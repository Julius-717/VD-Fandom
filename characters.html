                        Damon Salvatore is one of the two main male protagonists of The Vampire Diaries. Damon was a
                        178-year-old vampire and distant descendant of Silas but now he's human, since his younger brother,
                        Stefan Salvatore, injected him with the cure. He was a major antagonist in the first part of Season One.
                        He was born during the 1800s and lived in the colonial town of Mystic Falls with his brother Stefan, his
                        father, Giuseppe Salvatore, and also with his mother Lillian Salvatore until her death in 1858. He
                        became a vampire in 1864. At the time of his return to Mystic Falls, Damon and Stefan hadn't seen each
                        other in fifteen years due to their bitter and violent relationship.
