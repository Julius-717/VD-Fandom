            <h3>Synopsis</h3>
            <p>Four months after the tragic car accident that killed her parents, 17-year-old Elena Gilbert and her
                15-year-old brother Jeremy are still learning how to deal with grief and move their lives forward.
                Elena
                has always been the "perfect girl": popular, beautiful, and full of friends. But now she must learn
                to
                hide her sadness from the world.
                <p>As the new school year begins, Elena and her classmates are fascinated by a mysterious and
                    charming
                    new classmate, Stefan Salvatore. Stefan and Elena immediately approach, unbeknownst to the girl
                    that
                    Stefan is a hundreds-year-old vampire, fighting for a peaceful life among humans, while his
                    brother,
                    Damon, is the embodiment of vampire violence and brutality.</p>
                <p>Now these two vampire brothers - one good, one bad - are at war for Elena's soul and the souls of
                    her
                    friends, family, and all the inhabitants of the small town of Mystic Falls.</p>
                <p>The series is based on LJ Smith's novels.</p>
