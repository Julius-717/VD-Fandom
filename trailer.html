            <h2>TRAILER</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                The series is set in the fictional town of Mystic Falls, Virginia, a town charged with supernatural
                history since its settlement of migrants from New England in the late 19th century. It follows the
                life of Elena Gilbert (Nina Dobrev), a teenage girl who has just lost both parents in a car
                accident, as she falls in love with a 162-year-old vampire named Stefan Salvatore (Paul Wesley).
                Their relationship becomes increasingly complicated as Stefan's mysterious older brother Damon
                Salvatore (Ian Somerhalder) returns, with a plan to bring back their past love Katherine Pierce, a
                vampire who looks exactly like Elena. Although Damon is initially the villain and harbors a grudge
                against his brother for forcing him to become a vampire, he later reconciles with Stefan and falls
                in love with Elena, creating a love triangle among the three. Both brothers protect Elena as they
                face various villains and threats to their town, including Katherine. The brothers' history and the
                town's mythology are revealed through flashbacks as the series goes on.
                Additional storylines revolve around the other inhabitants of the town, most notably Elena's younger
                brother Jeremy Gilbert (Steven R. McQueen), her best friends Bonnie Bennett (Kat Graham) and
                Caroline Forbes (Candice King), their mutual friends Tyler Lockwood (Michael Trevino) and Matt
                Donovan (Zach Roerig), and their history teacher, vampire hunter Alaric Saltzman (Matthew Davis).
                The town's politics are orchestrated by descendants of the original founding families, all
                comprising a "Founders' Council." The founding families of Mystic Falls include the Salvatores, the
                Gilberts, the Fells, the Forbes, and the Lockwoods. They guard the town mainly from vampires,
                although there are many more supernatural threats such as werewolves, witches, hybrids, and ghosts.
