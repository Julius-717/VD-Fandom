            <P>Adapted for TV by Kevin Williamson (Dawson's Creek, The Following) and Julie Plec, The Vampire Diaries
                debuted a year after the onset of the Twilight phenomenon. The sense of opportunism was strong (though
                the books that inspired the series predate Stephenie Meyer's work) and Kevin Williamson knew it. Known
                for his shrewd text, the showrunner (who is also the creator of the Panic quadrilogy) soon began to
                apply his mark to the characters and even though it was discredited as being “another vampire
                production”, the most attentive could realize that with regard to For entertainment, The Vampire Diaries
                was a great example of fun..</P>
            <P>The play had a simple premise: Stefan (Paul Wesley) and Damon (Ian Somerhalder) were two brothers who had
                disputed the love of the same woman centuries ago. Already in our time, they will stop at the family's
                old home in a small town called Mystic Falls and there they also fall in love with the “copy” of this
                woman who transformed them: sweet Elena (Nina Dobrev). Stefan had forcibly transformed his brother in
                the past, but soon assumed the position of “guilty creature”, leaving the post of “relentless creature”
                for his brother, a dynamic clearly inspired by the elements of writer Anne Rice, who used the same tool
                in relationship between Lestat and Louie, characters from the classic Interview with the Vampire.</P>
            <P>As with all fantasy series, the world of The Vampire Diaries soon found the inevitable path of
                exaggeration. In its first two seasons, the series has created a safe and well-planned story. Williamson
                dropped out of command shortly thereafter (as he usually does), and though more downcast, the show still
                managed to set aside iconic moments for years to come, such as the "young lady" vampirization and the
                very construction of her relationship with Damon. However, production began its eighth and final year
                clearly showing that it had already fallen into the abyss of banality: as with all dramaturgies of its
                kind, the risk, the death, the fear.</P>
